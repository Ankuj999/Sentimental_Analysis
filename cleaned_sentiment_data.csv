2025-03-17,Punjab Holds the Key to AAPâ€™s Future After Delhi Defeat,https://frontline.thehindu.com/politics/punjab-elections-aap-crisis-bhagwant-mann-arvind-kejriwal-bjp-congress/article69234257.ece&ved=2ahUKEwiF_4aEltWLAxUMSmwGHcOOPBQQxfQBegQIABAC&usg=AOvVaw2_ouaeivtdyT0l0_AfdNLI,Published Feb Ist Mins Read The Fall Of The Aam Aadmi Party AAP In The DELHI Assembly Election Has Sent Shock Waves Through Punjab The Only State Where The Party Currently Holds Power The Aaps Defeat At The Hands Of The BJP Has Undoubtedly Lifted The Spirits Of Both The Congress And Shiromani Akali Dal Badal Two Key Players In The Sikhmajority Border State This Is Despite The Fact That The Congress Failed To Secure A Single Seat In The DELHI Assembly Election For The Third Consecutive Time While Sad Badal Chose Not To Field Any Candidates In The National Capital This Time Round The DELHI Results Have Certainly Added A New Layer Of Intrigue To Punjab Politics As These Parties Gear Up For Future Battles Following The Aaps Crushing Defeat Party Convenor And Former DELHI Chief Minister Arvind KEJRIWAL Met With Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann His Cabinet Colleagues And Party Mlas In DELHI The AAP Claimed That The Meeting Was Held To Thank Them For Their Efforts In The DELHI Election And To Discuss Making Punjab A Model State Ahead Of The Assembly Election However Critics Viewed It As Kejriwals Attempt To Keep The Besieged Party Intact In Punjab And Reassert His Influence Over The State Government After His Own Electoral Loss In DELHI Perception Problem The Mann Government Has Been Grappling With A Public Perception Problem Facing Criticism That It Lacks Governance Experience And It Is Being Remotely Controlled From DELHI Also In October The State Government Appointed Vibhav Kumar Kejriwals Former Personal Assistant As Chief Advisor To Mann Which Many Observers Said Was Done On Kejriwals Recommendation Also Read Unkept Promises In Punjab Haunt AAP In DELHI Clearly The Aaps Political Future Now Hinges On Its Performance In Punjab However Observers Warned That Any Overt Interference By The DELHI Leadership In Manns Government Or The Continued Diversion Of State Resources For The Partys Campaigns Outside Punjab Could Prove Counterproductive Such Actions Risk Alienating A Region With Deeply Rooted Subnationalist Sentiments Potentially Undermining KEJRIWAL And The Aaps Credibility In Their Sole Stronghold Ashutosh Kumar Head Of The Political Science Department At Panjab University Said For The AAP Balancing Central Authority With Regional Autonomy Will Be Critical To Sustaining Its Influence In Punjab Now While Ensuring It Delivers A Success Story That Can Be Leveraged In Punjab In The Next Election And Elsewhere For Political Survival Despite Having Been In Power For Three Years The Aaps Punjab Unit Continues To Be The Victim Of Widespread Disillusionment With Other Political Parties In The State Observers Have Also Criticised The Aaps Excessive Reliance On Its Punjab Unit For Campaign Purposes Elsewhere Arguing That It Has Disrupted Daily Governance In The State Following The Partys Setback In DELHI The Mannled Government Convened A Cabinet Meeting After A Gap Of Over Four Monthsa Delay Attributed To The Chief Minister And His Cabinet Colleagues Campaigning Extensively For The Party In DELHI And Haryana Controlling Punjab From DELHI The Aaps Recent DELHI Meeting Has Also Cemented Public Perception In Punjab That That The Partys Central Leadership Is Seeking To Exert Greater Control Over The Mann Government Ashutosh Kumar Said It Is Being Argued That The Meeting Held In DELHI At The Expense Of Punjabs Exchequer Could Have Easily Been Conducted Via Video Conference Such Moves Risk Fuelling Scepticism Among Punjabs Electorate Who Are Already Wary Of External Interference In The States Governance Jagtar Singh A Chandigarhbased Political Commentator And Author Claimed That During The Meeting KEJRIWAL Instructed Mlas From Punjab To Approach Him Directly If Bureaucrats Failed To Comply With Their Directives He Said This Undermines The Authority Of The Chief Minister And Signals The Creation Of A Parallel Power Centre It Raises Genuine Concerns About External Interference In State Affairs Some Analysts Also Believe That The Recent Turn Of Events Presents An Opportunity For Mann To Step Out Of Kejriwals Shadow And Establish Himself As A Leader In His Own Right With Genuine Political Agency Harjeshwar Singh A Political Analyst Who Teaches History At Sri Guru Gobind Singh College Chandigarh Said How Bhagwant Mann Navigates Through Fresh Challenges Posed By A Weakened KEJRIWAL Is To Be Seen As He In All Likelihood Will Be Receiving Backend Support From BJP Which Would Like To Decimate His Rival The AAP Burst Onto The National Stage In When It Secured Power In DELHI After Positioning Itself As A Party With A Difference It Charged Rival Parties As Serving As Havens For Opportunistic Turncoats While Portraying Its Leaders As Dedicated Workers Committed To Cleansing Politics In The Country However The Partys Image Has Faced Significant Erosion With As Many As Eight Outgoing AAP Mlas Defecting To The BJP After They Were Denied Tickets For The Assembly Election These Defectors Have Accused The AAP Of Being Plagued By Corruption And Deviating From Its Original Ideology Congress BJP Keen To Weaken AAP According To Ashutosh Kumar The Aaps Electoral Defeat In DELHI Has Cast Doubts On Its Ability To Deliver On Its Promise Of Alternative Politics In Punjab He Said Once A Party That Championed Anticorruption The End Of Vip Culture And Governance At Peoples Doorsteps The AAP Now Risks Being Perceived As Just Another Political Entity He Added Both The Congress And The BJP Have Found Common Ground In Their Efforts To Weaken The AAP For The BJP In Particular Eliminating A Competitor That Resonates With The Lower And Middle Classes While Offering A Milder Version Of Hindutva Is A Strategic Priority Congress Leader Partap Singh Bajwa Who Is The Leader Of The Opposition In The Punjab Assembly Has Claimed That Mann Might Follow The Example Of Eknath Shinde In Maharashtra He Has Predicted An Imminent Split In The AAP Punjab Unit Which Has Seats In The Member Assembly However Mann Himself Has Rubbished Such Claims Political Observers Have Also Ruled Out Such A Possibility In The Near Future In The Punjab Assembly The Congress Has Members While The BJP Has Only Two Sad Badal Has Three Members While One Mla Belongs To The Bahujan Samaj Party Bsp There Is Also One Independent Mla However Ashutosh Kumar Noted That While The Aapled Government Faces No Immediate Threat Internal Dissent Could See Some Leaders Break Away He Said The Mann Governments Strugglestackling Drugs Redressing Farm Distress Dismantling The Sand Mafia And Curbing Corruptionecho The Aaps Challenges Unmet Promises Including Direct Financial Aid To Women Coupled With Rising Subsidies Have Only Exacerbated Punjabs Mounting Debt He Added That Concerns About Increased Interference From The Delhibased AAP Leadership May Be Unfounded As The State Units Autonomy Is Likely To Grow After The DELHI Election Outcome Any Attempt By A Desperate High Command To Overstep Would Backfire As Regionalism Plays A Key Role In Punjabs Identity Politics After The Bjps Resounding Victory In DELHI Punjab BJP Chief Sunil Jakhar And Union Minister Ravneet Singh Bittu Stated That Prime Minister Narendra Modi Will Have To Take Up The Task Of Making Punjab Aapfree How BJP Might Grow In The Lok Sabha Election The BJP Went Alone In Punjab After Parting Ways With Sad Despite The Yearlong Farmers Agitation It Improved Its Electoral Performance Securing Per Cent Of The Vote It Finished As Runnerup In Three Constituencies Now The BJP Will Likely Seek More Opportunities To Mobilise Radical Hindu Elements Especially In Urban Areas Kumar Said The Congress Is Wellpositioned With A Solid Support Base Among Hindus And Sikhs As The AAP Declines Both The Congress And The BJP Stand To Gain In The State The Victory Of BJP Candidate Manjinder Singh Sirsa In Delhis Rajouri Garden Seat Marks A Significant Shift In Sikh Political Dynamics As The Saffron Party Steadily Occupies Ground Once Held By Sad Badal Sirsa A Former Sad Badal Leader And Expresident Of The DELHI Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee Dsgmc Complements The Bjps Ambitious Plans For Punjab Where It Has Been Working Hard To Project Itself As A Prosikh Force A Key Aide Of Sad Leader Sukhbir Badal He Had Quit The Party In Ahead Of The Punjab Assembly Election Harmeet Singh Celebrated Sirsas Success On Instagram And Attributed It To The Unwavering Support And Trust Of The People In The Bjps Vision For Development And Governance The Bjps Decision To Bring Manjinder Singh Sirsa Into Chief Minister Rekha Guptas DELHI Cabinet Goes Beyond Mere Representation It Is A Strategic Move Aimed At Punjab According To Political Analysts Sad State Of Affairs Singh Himself Had Resigned From Sads DELHI Unit Just A Week After His Election As Dsgmc President In Sirsas Win Adds To The List Of Successes For BJP Sikh Candidates In DELHI Including Tarvinder Singh Marwah And Arvinder Singh Lovely Sad Has Been Battling Erosion Of Voter Base On One Hand And Loss Of Key Leaders On The Other Citing The Examples Of DELHI Patna Nanded And Haryana Sukhbir Badal Has Also Accused The Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh Rss Of Taking Control Of Sikh Shrines And Bodies To Strengthen The BJP And Weaken Sad Badal Jagtar Singh Said Sad Once A Dominant Force In Punjab Politics Has Been Marginalised Leaving A Political Vacuum Who Fills That Space Will Shape The Broader Political Scenario Leading Up To The Election He Added In Punjab The BJP Cannot Be Assessed The Same Way As In States Like Uttar Pradesh Or DELHI Neither The Jan Sangh Nor Its Successor The BJP Has Ever Held A Dominant Position In Punjabs Politics Since It Has Largely Contested Elections In Alliance With The Akali Dal Except In When The Akalis Sat Out Now The BJP Is Testing The Waters On Its Own It Can Certainly Expand But It Is Unlikely To Dominate The Larger Political Space Also Read Will The Rise Of Waris Punjab De Reignite Radical Politics In Punjab The Aapled Government In Punjab Has Come Under Scrutiny For Its Handling Of The States Financial Challenges Facing Allegations Of Securing Highinterest Loans Reckless Spending And Amending Property Tax Laws Amid Mounting Debt Whither Punjab Model Jagtar Singh Said After The DELHI Debacle The AAP Must Rethink Its Strategy Freebies Alone Wont Guarantee Victory In Punjab Where Political Dynamics Are Distinct The Party Has Yet To Grasp This It Led To Its Heavy Defeat In The Lok Sabha Election In Which It Could Win Just Three Of Seats After His Meeting With KEJRIWAL In DELHI Mann Told Mediapersons That His Governments Priorities Remain Focused On Education Healthcare Electricity And Water However His Remarks Appeared Disconnected From Several Broader Challenges Facing The State Our Government In Punjab Has Already Exceeded Its Commitments He Asserted Highlighting Initiatives Like The Closure Of Toll Plazas And The Abolition Of Multiple Pensions For Mlas Despite The Aaps Muchcelebrated DELHI Model Of Governance It Could Not Come Back To Power After Two Full Terms Now The Pressing Question For The Party Is Whether It Can Script A Success Story In A Fullfledged State By Crafting A Compelling Punjab Model Ahead Of The Assembly Election

Strategy",https://frontline.thehindu.com/politics/why-aap-lost-delhi-political-failure/article69219062.ece&ved=2ahUKEwiF_4aEltWLAxUMSmwGHcOOPBQQxfQBegQIARAC&usg=AOvVaw0u4iZ_1-6y2c8bHqTvhq7c,Published Feb Ist Mins Read In His Book Republic Of Caste Anand Teltumbde Described The Aam Aadmi Party As A Political App For The Neoliberal Era It Was A Telling Analogy Like A Mobile Application The Aaps Political Package Seemed To Offer A Range Of Functionalities To Its Citizen Consumers The Proposed Functionalities Centred On Improving The Quality Of Public Goods Like Health And Education Along With Subsidised Provision Of Welfare Services Like Electricity Drinking Water And Transportation In The Essay Teltumbde Had Issued A Pointed Warning To The Aaps Antipolitics Political Enterprise The Biggest Challenge Before A Fledgling Entity Is To Scale Up Or Be Gobbled By The Bigger Sharks Remember What Microsoft Did To Netscape Or What Amazon Is Doing To Flipkart That Is Pretty Much What Happened In The Recent DELHI Election Not Only Did The Aaps Efforts To Scale Up Prove Less Than Successful Barring The Triumph In Punjab But The Party Also Failed To Upgrade Its Package Offer New Functions Even As Competitors Copied Its Core Offerings After A Little Over A Decade In Power The Electorate Of DELHI Uninstalled The AAP From Its Seat Of Power And Installed Its Monopolist Rival The BJP Which Was Aided By Its Enormous Advantages In Terms Of Material Resources And Institutional Power Although The Descriptor Of Postideological Politics Is Customarily Attached To The AAP The Party Is Hardly Alone In Its Apolitical Or Technocratic Approach To Public Policy The Post S Phase Of Indian Politics Has Been Marked By A General Trend Of The Depoliticisation Of The Domain Of The Political Economy By Political Economy We Basically Mean Questions Of How Political Power Structures Economic Relationships And How That Relates To The Distribution Of Income And Wealth As Far As These Distributional Issues Are Concerned The Aaps Apolitical Stance Has Been In Lockstep With The Times The Only Difference Is Its Public Disavowal Of The Planks Of Social Justice And Secularism To Which Other Parties At Least Offer The Thin Gruel Of Rhetorical Commitment The Point Is Worth Mentioning Because The Postideological Labelling Of The AAP Sometimes Elides The Wider Context In Which The Party Emerged In Other Words The Party Is Not A Unique Or Special Political Organisation Contrary To The Portrayal Of Both Its Supporters And Critics In Fact One Can Make A Good Case That Arvind Kejriwals Rule Was Less Technocratic Than The Preceding Year Reign Of The Sheila Dikshitled Congress Where Bureaucrats Held The Reigns Of Governance With Little Popular Participation Except For Expanding The Power Of Resident Welfare Associations Within Their Elite Enclaves The AAP Government In This Sense For All Its Mufflerclad Populist Garb Of Aam Aadmi Common Man Represented Much More Of A Continuation Rather Than A Break Also Read Arvind KEJRIWAL People Will Vote For Kaam Ki Rajneeti In The Election The First Wave Election For The AAP A Lokniticsds Survey Finding Highlighted Why The Electorate Had Junked The Congress For The Newbie Party On A Question Asking Respondents What They Thought Of The Dikshit Governments Record On Development And Corruption Per Cent Ticked The Box DELHI Developed During Shiela Dixits Tenure But Corruption Also Increased It Was This Perception Of Widespread Corruption That The AAP And Its Precursor INDIA Against Corruption Had Skilfully Deployed As A Plank To Oust The Congress And Ironically The AAP Itself Has Now Been Pushed Out Partly On The Perception Of Corruption Fed This Time By The BJP Political Machine With Some Help From The Congress Again A Lokniti Csds Finding Bears This Out While Six Out Of DELHI Respondents Claimed Satisfaction With The Work Of The State Government Nearly Twothirds Also Rated The AAP As Somewhat Or Highly Corrupt In Both Cases Therefore The Antiincumbency Sentiment Which Ousted The Respective Congress And AAP Regimes Reflected Not So Much Anger Against Nonperformance As Much As A Sense Of Weary Disillusionment A Popular Disenchantment With Politics Thus Marking Both The Spectacular Birth And The Quiet Demise Of The AAP Rule In DELHI To Adequately Analyse The DELHI Verdict Therefore It Is Important To First Get A Handle On What Constitutes This Popular Disillusionment Party Building Without Grassroots As Political Anthropologists Have Long Argued The Catchall Term Corruption As Used In Political Discourse Does Not Necessarily Indicate A Popular Resentment Towards Bribery Or Illicit Moneymaking The Saliency Of Corruption Lies In Its Communication Of Distance Between The Government And The Governed A Resentment Towards Exclusion Or Alienation From Structures Of Power One Might Quote From Red Tape Bureaucracy Structural Violence And Poverty In INDIA By Akhil Gupta One Of The Foremost Scholars Studying The Sociological Constitution Of The Term Corruption When Villagers Complained About The Corruption Of State Officials Therefore They Were Not Just Voicing Their Exclusion From Government Services Because These Were Costly Although That Was No Small Factor More Important They Were Expressing Frustration Because They Lacked The Cultural Capital Required To Negotiate Deftly For Those Services In This Light The Perception Of Corruption Is Not An Indictment Of The Moral Vacuity Of The Congress Or The AAP Leadership It Is An Indictment Of Their Model Of Party Building And Their Framework Of Political Imagination Let Us Take Each Aspect In Turn The Organisational Model Of Both The Congress And The Aapand This Can Be Extrapolated To Most Political Partieshas Three Salient Features One The Absence Of Any Grassroot Structure Comprised Of Political Activists Interfacing With The Population Two The Almost Exclusive Role Of The Organisation As A Vehicle For Coordinating Election Campaigns Lately With The Help Of Professional Management Third The Absence Of Structures Facilitating Upward Mobility Within The Organisation From Where The Party Can Draw Its Representatives The Latter Are Instead Mostly Drawn From Local Elites Near The Election Cycle To Sum Up In The Life Of An Ordinary Citizen The Party Is An Apparition Which Springs Up Like An Exotic Seasonal Fruit During The Campaign Period Unlike The Case With The BJP And Particularly Its Affiliate Organisations This Anaemic Model Of Party Building Stems From A Chronic Failure Of Political Imagination In The Limited Political Imagination Of The Congress Or The AAP There Is Hardly Any Role Of Popular Or Mass Mobilisation The Term Mobilisation Let Us Remember Has A Specific Meaning In Politics Different From Busing In Crowds For Rallies It Comes From A Certain European Left Tradition Think Antonio Gramsci Which Saw The Practice Of Politics As Akin To Longterm Warfare In This Vision Popular Constituencies And Political Activists Had To Be Educated And Prepared For Leadership Within Perpetual Sociopolitical Movements According To A Given Roadmap For Attaining Political Change Ideology Is Not Meant To Be A Set Of Proclamations Drafted Onto A Speech Or An Election Manifesto But The Principles Of The Party As Practised In The Terrain Of Everyday Grassroot Politics In INDIA Too These Concepts Carried Considerable Purchase At Least In The First Few Decades After Independence This Was Especially The Case For Socialist Communist And Backward Caste Parties Which Brought A Large Section Of Small Farmers And Rural Workers Into The Sphere Of Active Political Participation To Be Fair Energetic Bands Of AAP Volunteers Did Initially Attempt To Perform This Role Of Empowering People Through Political Education Yet Those Efforts Were Soon Hobbled By A Certain Middleclass Reformism At The Core Of The Partys Political Imagination With Its Attendant Caste And Class Biases As The Political Sociologist Srirupa Roy Recounted From Her Fieldwork On AAP Campaigns In Her Book The Political Outsider But In This Slum Location The Prototypical Aam Aadmi As Per AAP Volunteers Was Not Just The Victim Of A Corrupt Establishment He Was A Victim Of His Own Ignorance Fear And Gandagi Ki Aadat Dirty Habits In Other Words Political Education Here Had Less To Do With Empowering The Slum Dweller On How To Procedurally Avail Or Politically Struggle For His Legal Rights And Entitlements And More Of An Advocacy For Moral Reform In The Gandhian Socialist Mould Of Yesteryears Reviving Urban Mobilisation For A Long Time Now The Socioeconomic Condition Of The Urban Precariat Has Been Ripe For An Urban Popular Mobilisation On Pressing Livelihood Issues Analogous To The Rural Peasant Mobilisations Of The Early Postindependence Decades We Do Not Need To Talk About Hypotheticals The Leftwing Partymovements Which Took Power Amidst The Pink Tide Of Latin America At The Turn Of This Century Have Been Driven Largely By Coalitions Led By Urban Working Classes Along With The Indigenous Communities It Has Been These New Working Classes Drawn From The Bulging Informal Sector Which Have Provided The Motor Engine For Dominant Leftwing Party Coalitions The Brazilian Workers Party Of President Luiz Incio Lula Da Silva The Mexican Morena Of President Claudia Sheinbaum As Well As The Movimiento Al Socialismo Movement Towards Socialism Party Of Bolivia And The Frente Amplio Broad Front Of Uruguay Of Course None Of This Happened Automatically In Neoliberal Hegemony And The Pink Tide In Latin America Breaking Up With Tina The Political Scientist Tom Chodor Examined How These Partyled Political Movements Brought Together Marginalized And Excluded Subjectivities To Forge Successful Antielite Coalitions Chodor Argued That This Coalition Strategy Followed Gramscis Insistence That The Construction Of A Radical Collective Will Is An Active And Reciprocal Educative Relationship Illuminating The Intersecting Dimensions Of Class Race And Gender Exploitation Another Book On Brazils Urban Governance Reforms Under The Workers Party Bootstrapping Democracy Detailed How The Participatory Budgeting Mechanism Transformed The Whole Architecture Of Local Governance In A Number Of Cities The Porto Alegre Model Named After The City Where It Was First Introduced Involves Citizens Directly Deciding On How The Municipal Budget Is Allocated Based On Open Meetings With Structured Discussions Thus Ensuring A Very Broad Degree Of Participation In Governance This Wildly Popular Governance Innovation Has Since Become A Keystone Of The Popular Empowerment Legacy Of The Workers Party It Is Worth Quoting The Authors Gianpaolo Baiocchi Et Al As They Describe The Conditions Of Urban Brazil Which Created The Bottomup Demand For Reform Driven By An Agrarian Transition That Has Not Only Been Exceptionally Rapid But Also Dominated By Capital Intensive And Labourdisplacing Modernization Ruralurban Migration Has Exploded And Brazils Cities Have Had To Accommodate One Hundred Million New Residents Since This Has Produced A Rapid And Largely Unregulated Growth Of Precarious Peripheral Areas Exacerbating What Were Already Pronounced Problems Of Urban Poverty And Informality With Very Few Changes This Description Can Almost Exactly Fit Presentday DELHI The City Also Exuded The Same Bottomup Demand For Participative Democracy Manifested In The Newborn Aaps Unprecedented Triumph In And Then The Sweep Of In Fact After Its Victory The AAP Also Announced With Much Fanfare Its Decision To Experiment With The Model Of Participatory Budgeting The Party Promised To Realize Its Goal Of Swaraj Through Such An Exercise Of Budget Deliberation Via Popular Assemblies A Pilot Programme Was Announced Which Ran Fitfully For One Year After Which The Whole Thing Was Scrapped And Forgotten As One Study Put It Participation In Neighbourhood Assemblies Was Much Weaker Than Expected The Average Number Of Participants Was Around Persons Out Of About Local Residents And The Selection Of Priority Work Was Not Prepared Through Prior Discussions In Other Words It Turned Out To Be A Case Of Deft Political Marketing Minus The Political Commitment Towards Actual Popular Participation The Aaps Politics Makes Much Of Ameliorating The Depredations Of Informality And Illegality Which Mar The Lives Of Most Of Delhis Citizenry Without Ever Calling Into Question The Preservation Of These Statemandated Boundaries Which Only Serve To Keep The Marginalised In Their Place As Meek Dependents To Their Political Patrons Also Read Cautious And Calibrated Arvind KEJRIWAL Fights His Toughest Battle What About The Congress Party And Its Political Imagination The Party

The Seattoseat Contest The Shine Of The KEJRIWAL Model Faded The Aam Aadmi Party AAP Had Set A Wellknown Trap For The BJP In The DELHI Battle Arvind Vs Who But The BJP Chose To Turn The Tables By Not Only Ignoring The Question That Had Troubled The Saffron Party In The And Polls But Also By Converting The Battle For DELHI Into A Seattoseat Contest Advertisement Once The BJP Got Rid Of The KEJRIWAL Factor The Stage For Local Battles In Each Assembly Was Set The Resurgence Of Delhis Old Netas Such As Tarvinder Singh Marwah And Neeraj Basoya Considered Done And Dusted Is An Apt Example But The Symptoms Of The Larger Problems For The AAP Had Become Prominently Visible Ever Since The Last Leg Of The DELHI Campaign Irrespective Of The Results They Were Bound To Have Short And Longterm Ill Effects On The Party Upper Class Uprising On February When DELHI Stepped Out To Vote The Polling Stations Also Witnessed Enthusiasm Amongst The Upper Middle Class And The Upperclass Voters Or To Put It Differently It Was Their Frustration With Aaps Political Model That Drove Them To The Polling Booths Advertisement DELHI Chief Minister Atishi Cast Her Vote At A Government School In Kalkajis B Block At The Very Booth Those From The Upper Economic Strata Spoke Of The Reasons Which Brought Them To The Polling Stations Broken Roads Blocked Drainage And Lack Of Sanitation Similar Voices Could Be Heard At The Polling Station Where Arvind KEJRIWAL And His Family Cast Their Votes In Any Other State These Would Be Issues Of Civic Body Polls But In DELHI This Section Of Voters Decided To Punish KEJRIWAL And His Party In The Assembly Polls For The Citys Ailing Civic Infrastructure AAP Clinched The Mcd From The BJP In December Due To Its Thin Margin The Fate Of The Aapled Mcd Was Similar To That Of The Aapled DELHI Government Governance Hurdles Stemming From War With Bureaucracy And No Control On The Financing And Decisionmaking Bodies Of The Mcd The Standing Committee The Zonal Committees The Aaps Failure To Manage The Affairs In The Civic Body Added Wood To The Fire While The AAP Boasts Of The Changes It Brought To Delhis Health And Education Infrastructure The Health Of The Citys Civic Infrastructure Was Heading Towards A Coma The DELHI Floods Or Water Logging During The Monsoon Had Left Scars On The Memory Of Delhis Voters Advertisement Moreover The Angst Against Aaps Freebies Model Amongst Delhis Upperclass Voters Is Not A Hidden Fact Even In The Campaign The AAP Chief Constantly Spoke About How Each Workingclass Family Of DELHI Is Saving Rs Because Of His Government His Speeches Were Focused On Consolidating The Workingclass Voters In DELHI The Upper Classes Concerns Were Completely Obliterated In The Aaps Campaign Possibly The BJP Managed To Harness This Anger And Provoked Them To Step Out And Cast Their Vote The Yamuna Row When Things Still Seemed To Be Going The Aaps Way The Party Decided To Stir A Storm In The Last Leg Of The DELHI Campaign AAP Chief KEJRIWAL Accused The Bjpled Haryana Government Of Poisoning Yamuna Water Which He Claimed Could Trigger Genocide In DELHI The Swords Were Out Soon The BJP And AAP Delegations Knocked The Election Commissions Gate While Their Leaders Sparred From The Tv Studios To The Ghats Of Yamuna For The Common Voters It Was A Reminder Of The Fact How The AAP Stays At Loggerheads With The Central Government The Raj Niwas And The Bjpled Neighbouring States On Almost Every Other Issue Of Governance Notably Till Kejriwals Seemingly Outlandish Claims The DELHI Voters Had Blurred Memory Of This Bickering In The Last Leg Of The DELHI Campaign AAP Managed To Bring Back The Attention Of Voters To This Neverending Combative Mode Of Their Government Advertisement Fearmongering Press Conferences In The Last Week Of The Campaign KEJRIWAL Addressed A Couple Of Digital Press Conferences These Were The Video Messages To DELHI Voters And Specifically Those In His Constituency New DELHI Dont Let Anyone Ink Your Finger A Night Before The Polling You Will Go To Jail If You Sell Your Vote Were Key Phrases In These Video Messages In Electoral Politics Such Fearmongering Tactics Often Backfire The AAP Was No Exception Instead Of Launching A Whisper Campaign The AAP Chief Made Official Video Statements Which Were Negative In Its Tone The Last Week Of Poll Campaigns Is Often Exploited By The Political Parties To Consolidate Its Poll Promises Spread Positive Messages And Address Issues Which Could Strengthen Its Voter Base On The Contrary The AAP Leaders Were Busy Making Allegations Against The BJP Parvesh Verma And Slamming Cec Rajiv Kumar Advertisement Lack Of Structure Within The AAP Even After Years Of Its Inception The AAP Lacks A Proper Structure Besides The Political Affairs Committee Pac One Can Hardly Point Out At Functional Wings Of The AAP Let Alone A Robust System For Screening Of Candidates Or A Committee For Clearance Of Such Tickets The Partys Functioning Is Largely Based On Surveys And The Decisionmaking Is Centred Around Arvind KEJRIWAL Or Those Whose Powers Stems From The AAP Chiefs Office The Impact Of Lack Of Structure Within The Party Leaves Its Imprints On Different Aspects From Failure To Maintain A Consistent Ideological Line To Handling Of Communication And Media It Led To Adhocism Even In Its DELHI Campaign If The AAP Wants To Reignite Its Engine For The Punjab And The Gujarat Campaigns Addressing This Issue Becomes More Pertinent Published By Anuja Jha Published On Feb Tune In

To The INDIA Fix By Shoaib Daniyal This Time I Unpack The Aam Aadmi Party Defeat In DELHI And Try And Draw An Insight From It That Applies Across Indian Politics The Relevance Or Not Of Corruption As An Issue As Always If Youve Been Sent This Newsletter And Like It To Get It In Your Inbox Every Week Sign Up Here Click On Follow By Indian Standards The Anticorruption Movement Of Was Not Particularly Large The Ramlila Maidan In DELHI Where It Began Has A Capacity Of Around A Modest Number For Even Routine Political Rallies In INDIA However What Made It Different Was The Incredible Media Attention It Received For Months It Dominated Headlines Eventually One Section Of This Movement Used This Publicity To Launch A New Political Outfit The Aam Aadmi Party Boosted By Media Momentum The Aam Aadmi Party Shot Off The Blocks In Its Very First Election For The DELHI Assembly It Managed To Form The Government Curiously It Did So With Support From The Congress The Very Party That The Aaps Founders Had Attacked As Irredeemably Corrupt Just A Couple Of Years Before Welfare Corruption Subsequently In The And DELHI Elections AAP Won Massive Mandates It Did This Not By Appealing To Its Origin As A Party Battling Corruption But By Reinventing Itself As An Economically Populist Force Highlighting Its Development Work And Welfare Schemes Targeted At The Citys Working Class This Dynamic Was Maintained In The Assembly Polls The Result Of Which Were Declared On Saturday AAP Contested The Election On Its Welfare Record Not On Fighting Corruption In Fact The Elections Were Conducted Against The Backdrop Of Serious Allegations Of Corruption Against AAP Senior Party Leaders Including Chief Minister Arvind KEJRIWAL Had Even Spent Time In Prison However This Did Not Seem To Have Played A Significant Role In Aaps Loss Eventually It Was Dissatisfaction With The Aaps Welfare Delivery That Resulted In A Portion Of Its Workingclass Support Moving To The Bharatiya Janata Party The Number Was Not Large Though AAP Got Nearly Of The Popular Vote Less Than Two Percentage Points Behind The Winner The BJP Correlation And Causation The Aam Aadmi Partys Journey In DELHI Therefore Has An Interesting Insight For Indian Politics As A Whole Bigticket Corruption Is A Hot Button Topic For Indias Middle Classes And Hence The Media However In Elections Most Voters Do Not Vote Directly On The Issue Of Corruption This Is Why AAP Had To Concentrate Its Efforts In DELHI On Delivering Welfare Not Fighting Corruption This Is Not A New Insight Research From Shows That Even As The Congress Was Relentlessly Pilloried By The Media On The Issue Of Big Ticket Corruption Most Voters Had Not Even Heard Of The Names Of The Alleged Scams Even More Remarkably Knowledge Of A Scam Did Little To Influence Voter Choice Attributing The Congresss Loss To Claims Of Corruption Might Be A Case Of Confusing Correlation With Causation Another Way To Observe This Same Insight Is To Look At The Teflon Immunity Enjoyed By The Modi Government Even In The Face Of Widespread Allegations Of Corruption Such As The Controversy About The Purchase Of Rafale Fighter Jets Or Claims That It Favours The Adani Group Indias Middle Class The Principal Cohort That Raises Its Voice Against Corruption Allegations Is A Strong Supporter Of Modi And The BJP Hence Since The Issue Of Corruption Has Taken A Back Seat Nationally As Indias Middle Class Voters Are Hesitant To Point Fingers At Their Own Political Choice Free Pass As The Recent Tax Cuts Show The Only Real Pressure That The Modi Government Has Faced From The Middle Class Has Been On Hard Economic Matters Wage Stagnation And Inflation Are Problems That Have Actually Channeled Middleclass Anger Against Modi In A Way That Say Being Seen As Close To Adani Has Never Done Why Does The Indian Voter Ignore Corruption When It Comes To The Hustings For One The Link Between Bigticket Corruption And Quality Of Life Is Difficult To See In Real Time A Voter Happy With Say Cash Transfers Would Hardly Abandon Modi Over His Alleged Connections With Adani Moreover Corruption Both Big And Small Is A Systemic Problem That No Party Seems To Be Able To Solve AAP Which Was Literally Created On An Anticorruption Platform Now Faces Allegations That It Used Kickbacks From Delhis Excise Scam To Fund Its Campaign In Goa While These Allegations Remain To Be Proved It Is Clear That The Massive Funds Required To Fight An Election Will Create Factors Extremely Conducive To Corruption Moreover Smallticket Corruption Think Small Bribes To Junior Officials Is So Pervasive That A Voter Pivoting Her Vote On It Makes Little Sense It Is Thus Little Wonder That Other Factors Easily Outweigh Corruption In An Indian Election

Feb Ist Mins Read New DELHI Was That One Feather Which Had Eluded Prime Minister Narendra Modis Cap For Years Modi Led The BJP To A Huge Victory In The Lok Sabha Election But Just Months Later The Saffron Party Led By Him Lost To The AAP Then A Political Newbie In The Assembly Election In The National Capital A Similar Story Unfolded In The State Election In These Defeats Are Believed To Have Rankled Modi But With Its Comprehensive Victory In The Assembly Election The BJP Has Finally Broken Its Year Streak Of Defeat On The Other Hand The AAP Which Emerged As The Fastestgrowing Political Party Over The Past Years Has Lost Its Citadel Where It Came Up With Its Muchpublicised DELHI Model Of Governance And Which Was Its Launchpad Into National Politics The Defeat Of The AAP And Former Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwals Own Loss In The New DELHI Seat Is A Huge Moral Defeat For The Partys National Convenor Since He Had Turned The Assembly Election Into A Referendum On His Leadership The BJP Has Recorded An Emphatic Victory Winning Out Of Seats In The Vidhan Sabha The AAP Has Been Reduced To Seats In The AAP Won Seats And The BJP And In The Election The AAP Won A Massive Mandate Of Seats And The BJP Just In This Election Which Saw A Direct Fight Between The BJP And The AAP The Congress Continued To Be On The Fringes Failing To Win A Single Seat Just Like In The And Elections It Was Quite Telling That Many AAP Bigwigs Were Vanquished Including Former Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia And Satyendar Jain And Saurabh Bharadwaj Who Were Ministers In The Outgoing Cabinet Among The Few Prominent AAP Leaders Who Managed To Win Are Chief Minister Atishi And Her Cabinet Colleagues Gopal Rai And Imran Hussain Also Read AAP Faces Existential Crisis As Liquor Scam Clouds Its Anticorruption Image The BJP Got Per Cent Of The Votes A Sizeable Jump From Per Cent In The Aaps Vote Share Dropped From Per Cent In To Per Cent This Time The Congress Only Marginally Improved Its Vote Percentage From Per Cent In To Per Cent DELHI Is Not Even A Full State But The Victory Means A Lot To The BJP Modi Declared Triumphantly At The BJP Headquarters The People Of DELHI Have Freed The Capital Of A Decade Of Aapda Disaster The Peoples Mandate To The BJP Is For Development Vision And Trust It Had Been Frustrating For The Party To Win In The General Election But Not In DELHI As KEJRIWAL And His Party Proved To Be A Big Hurdle The People Of DELHI Had Over The Past Years Voted Overwhelmingly In Favour Of The BJP In Lok Sabha Elections With Modis Leadership Being A Big Deciding Factor For Them However In The Assembly Election They Reposed Their Faith In KEJRIWAL And The AAP Sensing That This Was Its Best Chance To Win DELHI The BJP Banked On Antiincumbency Against The AAP Government And Its Main Target Was Kejriwals Image Against The Backdrop Of The Allegations Of Corruption Against Him And The Sheesh Mahal Claims BJP Leaders Said They Ensured That KEJRIWAL Could Not Use The Term Kattar Imaandaar Staunchly Honest Ever Again The Party Focussed On Local Issues Such As The Condition Of Roads Deficiencies In Sanitation Services Air Pollution And The Failure To Clean The Yamuna River The Party Reworked Its Stand On The AAP Governments Welfare Schemes Which It Had Earlier Described As Freebies It Went Out Of Its Way To Assure DELHI Voters That None Of The Existing Welfare Measures Would Be Rolled Back What Is Believed To Have Turned The Election Decisively In The Bjps Favour Is The Support Of The Middle Class In The Election And To A Large Extent In Too The Middle Class Backed The AAP Despite Voting For The BJP In The Lok Sabha Election KEJRIWAL When He Switched From Activism To Politics Was A Hero Of The Middle Class As He Walked In With The Promise To Rid The Political System Of Corruption That Image Took A Beating In The Runup To The Election The BJP Highlighted The Nonperformance Of The AAP Government And The Corruption That Its Leaders Allegedly Indulged In The Image Of The AAP As A Kattar Imaandaar Party Took A Beating And Kejriwals Personal Defeat Only Accentuated It Said The Political Analyst Harjeshwar Pal Singh And The BJP Continued To Woo Middleclass Voters And Marketed The Income Tax Concessions Announced In The Union Budget As A Gift To The People Of DELHI Modi Too Highlighted The Reworked Income Tax Rates In His Election Speeches I Feel The Election Scenario Changed On February When The Union Budget Was Presented The Tax Concessions For The Salaried Class Had A Big Impact Before That There Was The Announcement Of The Eighth Pay Commission Which Benefits Those Who Are In Government Jobs As Also The Pensioners And They Are Present In Sizeable Numbers In The Capital Said Abhay Kumar Dubey Professor At The Centre For The Study Of Developing Societies KEJRIWAL Did Not Waste Time In Conceding Defeat On The Results Day The Former Chief Minister Looking Visibly Dejected Said In A Video Message That He Hoped The Expectations With Which The People Had Voted For The BJP Would Be Fulfilled In The Years That The People Of DELHI Gave Us We Did A Lot Of Work For Them In Education Healthcare Water Electricity And We Tried To Provide Them With Relief In Various Ways And Improve The Infrastructure Of DELHI We Will Play The Role Of A Constructive Opposition And Do Social Service We Will Do Whatever Is Needed To Provide Succour To People He Said Highlights Sensing That This Was Its Best Chance To Win DELHI The BJP Banked On Antiincumbency Against The AAP Government And Its Main Target Was Kejriwals Image Against The Backdrop Of The Allegations Of Corruption Against Him BJP Leaders Said They Ensured That KEJRIWAL Could Not Use The Term Kattar Imaandaar Staunchly Honest Ever Again The Party Focussed On

Had Earlier Described As Freebies It Went Out Of Its Way To Assure DELHI Voters That None Of The Existing Welfare Measures Would Be Rolled Back AAP Leaders Said It Was An Extremely Difficult Election And They Were Not Even In The Reckoning A Few Months Back The Most Important Issue To Tackle According To Them Was Years Of Antiincumbency And Growing Discontent On The Ground The Developments In The Past Two And A Half Years Which Include Legal Amendments And Imprisonment Of Its Top Leadership Including KEJRIWAL And Sisodia Had Pushed The Party Into A Corner They Said According To A Top AAP Leader When KEJRIWAL Stepped Out Of Jail In September After He Was Granted Bail In The Excise Policy Case By The Supreme Court The Party Was Down And Out In The Capital If Elections Had Been Held Then It Would Have Won Just About Seats It Was Under These Circumstances That The Party Regrouped And Fought The Election Dubey Said The DELHI Verdict Has To Be Seen Against The Backdrop Of The Immense Pressure Under Which The AAP Government Worked Over The Past Two Years For The BJP DELHI Was Like A Laboratory In Which It Used Every Means Including Central Agencies To Mount Pressure On The AAP Legal Amendments Ensured That The DELHI Government Had No Authority Over Its Officers A New Lieutenant Governor Was Appointed After Which The Friction Between The Bjpruled Centre And The AAP Government Only Worsened This Gave Rise To A Feeling Especially Among The Middle Class That If The AAP Wins Again The BJP Will Not Allow It To Work He Said The Aaps Vote Percentage Showed That While The Middle Class Moved Away From The Party In This Election It Has Still Managed To Hold On To A Substantial Chunk Of Its Core Support Base Which Comprises The Poor Sections Of Society That Have Benefited From The AAP Governments Welfare Schemes Over The Past Years The Aaps Per Cent Vote Share And The Fact That There Is Just About A Per Cent Vote Difference Between The Party And The BJP Indicate That It Still Has A Sizeable Support Base In DELHI And Continues To Be A Force To Reckon With Also Read The AAP Anomaly On Whether An Alliance With The Congress Could Have Made A Difference To The Electoral Outcome Since The Partys Votes Were More Than The Winning Margin Of The BJP Over The AAP In Many Seats Dubey Said That Would Be A Simplistic Reading Of The Situation It Is Not Necessary That The Votes The Congress Got Would Have Transferred To The AAP Many Of These Votes Were In Any Case Antiaap Votes He Said The AAP Now Faces The Challenge Of Holding On To Its Leaders And Workers In DELHI Also There Would Be Ramifications For Its Government In Punjab The Only State Where The AAP Is In Power Now Aaps Defeat In DELHI Is Likely To Increase The Difficulties For The Party As Its Internal Cohesion Could Come Under Strain And The Leadership Of KEJRIWAL Can Be Questioned With A Vengeful BJP Breathing Down Its Neck Said Harjeshwar Pal Singh He Further Said Tensions Could Increase Between The DELHI Leadership And The Punjab Unit There Is Every Likelihood That KEJRIWAL Who Has Been Unaccustomed To Loss Of Power Will Try To Seek The Relative Safety As Well As Command Of Punjab Which Would Lead To A Renewed Tug Of War Between Him And Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann While On One Hand DELHI Has Given Modi The Personal Satisfaction Of Winning The National Capital After Years In Power At The Centre On The Other It Has Stripped KEJRIWAL Of His Moral Authority And Left His Party Staring At An Uncertain Future
